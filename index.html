            <ul>
                <li><b>Calendly --</b> You NEED one of these if you want to look professional. People can set up appointments to meet with you or do Zoom calls or phone calls.</li>
                <li><b>Instagram --</b> Make one of these to show off your videos. People can also contact you </li>
                <li><b>The Business Email --</b> Once this is set up fully, I can make a form for them to fill out and send inquiries directly to this email. This is actually a REALLY difficult process, so I'm not going to start this until you're sure about E V E R Y T H I N G else involved, okay? I need concrete details before I can do it.</li>
                <li><b>Business Phone # --</b> You should really get a separate line so you know people calling are calling for the business. If you use your personal number, you have to make sure you answer every time, otherwise you look unprofessional letting potential leads go to voicemail, and risk losing that sale completely.</li>
